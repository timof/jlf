# htmlDefuse (Timo Felbinger, 2011)
#
# this script is an ExtFilter for apache and will
# - quote HTML "hot" characters (', ", <, > and &) as  &...; -entities
# - convert ASCII characters 0x11...0x15 to hot characters ' ... & 
# - the script will discard all lines up to the line starting with
#     <!DOCTYPE HTML 
#   (this allows to include a plain-text hint to switch on this filter in html output)
#
# this filter is supposed to prevent ccs attacks in web applications:
# - reject characters 0x11...0x15 in user (text) input (they serve no useful purpose
#   there, and can be easily and unambiguously detected in an utf8 input stream)
# - use 0x11...0x15 to represent ' ... & in HTML output produced from cgi scripts
# - configure apache to use this script as output filter (see ExtFilterDefine)
