#
# this script is an ExtFilter for apache:
#
# the script will gobble all lines up to and including a line starting with
#   extfilter:
# followed by a filter type keyword. currently supported:
# - null: a null filter to just pass through any remaining lines
# - html: an outfilter for html which will
#   * quote HTML "hot" characters (', ", <, > and &) as  &...; -entities
#   * convert ASCII characters 0x11...0x15 to hot characters ' ... & 
#
# the html filter is supposed to prevent ccs attacks in web applications:
# - reject characters 0x11...0x15 in user (text) input (they serve no useful purpose
#   there, and can be easily and unambiguously detected in an utf8 input stream)
# - use 0x11...0x15 to represent ' ... & in HTML output produced from cgi scripts
# - configure apache to use this script as output filter (see ExtFilterDefine)
#
# it may be a good idea to include a plain-text hint to switch on this filter in html
# output before the extfilter line.
