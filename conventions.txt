reserved parameters with special meaning:

* generally, single letter parameter names are reserved and should not be used in application code0

* early parameters: treated as special cases in global.php: they are required before we have a session and
  thus before general parameter sanitization can be applied:
  - l ('login'): used to supply a single short piece of information required very early
  - f ('format'): the global format: determines, among other things, the http header 'Content-Type' setting
  - d: 'dontcache': a nonce to prevent pulling an outdated page out of some cache
  - m ('me'): script,parent_script,window,parent_window,thread,parent_thread
       (parents are optional and default to child; parent_script === 'self' has special meaning)
  - c ('cookie'): url-cookie (for clients which don't support browser cookies)
(before we have a session and thus before proper parameter handling can be applied)

* other special / reserved parameters:
  - s: used to POST arbitrary parameters, serialized, in any existing <form>
  - offs: POST scroll offset in 'self'-links (always through 'update_form')
  - debug: flag: debug mode?
  - action: POST parameter to request an action; 'nop' and '' are always allowed
  - i ('item'): GET or POST parameter to specify an item (often: for download)
  - message (deprecated): can be used to pass numerical information (often: a primary key) related to $action
  - itan: indexed TAN to catch re-POSTing of forms

* prefixes (supported for all parameters except some early ones)
  - P<n>_: priority prefix: P3_x and P7_x can both be used to pass x and if both ar present, P7_x will win
  - OR<n>_: if O3_x and O7_x are passed, the values will be OR-ed together in x (useful for <checkbox> lists)
  - UID_: use value as key to lookup value in uid table
  - DEREF_: passing DEREF_x=y and y=foo will set x=foo
